# Research-Paper-Summary-Project
## Overview
This project investigates the effectiveness of Virtual Reality Exposure-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (VRE-CBT) for treating severe anxiety disorders, including Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)1. The meta-analysis compares VRE-CBT with traditional Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and waitlist conditions2.

## Objectives
Primary Objective: Determine the efficacy of VRE-CBT on severe anxiety disorders compared to waitlist and CBT. <br>
Secondary Objectives: Examine differences in efficacy based on the type of anxiety disorder, recruitment method, and type of VRE-CBT34. Compare attrition rates between VRE-CBT and CBT5.
## Methods
Data Sources: Systematic literature searches in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase78. <br>
Inclusion Criteria: Studies with adult patients diagnosed with severe anxiety disorders (excluding specific phobias) according to DSM-IV, DSM-V, ICD-10, or ICD-11 criteria9. <br>
Analysis: Effect sizes (Hedges g) calculated for post-test and follow-up measurements using random effects model10.
## Results
Effectiveness: VRE-CBT showed a medium and significant effect compared to the waitlist and was as effective as CBT.
Attrition: No significant difference in dropout rates between VRE-CBT and CBT6.
## Conclusions
VRE-CBT is a promising alternative to traditional CBT for severe anxiety disorders11. Further high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings12.
